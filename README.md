7. **Data Quality**: The acquired imagery from different providers will adhere to agreed-upon quality standards, guaranteeing accurate and reliable analysis results.


### Step 2: High level design

## Step 3: Design Core Components

### 1. Client Interface
This is the entry point for client requests. Clients initiate requests to process satellite imagery by specifying parameters such as time frame, area of interest, image provider, and type. These requests are sent to the API Gateway.

### 2. API Gateway
This component manages and secures client requests by handling authorization, authentication, and routing. It receives requests from clients and forwards them to the Analysis Ready Data Service (ARDS) or triggers a Lambda function for image acquisition. The API Gateway is designed to provide a secure and scalable interface, handling a large volume of requests with low latency.

### 3. Analysis Ready Data Service (ARDS)
This service handles requests related to metadata and the state of satellite imagery. It checks if the requested imagery is available, manages area of interest administration, and handles ad-hoc requests. ARDS queries MongoDB for metadata and request states. If imagery is available, it retrieves it for processing. If imagery is not available, ARDS triggers a Lambda function to order new imagery. ARDS centralizes the management of metadata and request states, facilitating efficient image retrieval and request handling.

### 4. AWS Lambda
This service executes code in response to triggers, such as ordering new imagery when requested imagery is not available. It is triggered by the API Gateway, orders imagery from satellite providers, updates ARDS, and monitors the status of imagery acquisition. Lambda offers a serverless, on-demand execution environment, which is efficient and cost-effective for handling image ordering and status updates.

### 5. Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)
This component provides scalable and shared storage for satellite imagery, accessible by multiple EC2 instances. EFS stores acquired imagery, making it available for processing by EC2 instances. EFS is essential for handling large volumes of imagery and provides scalable concurrent access to file storage.

### 6. Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)
This service facilitates message-based communication for event-driven processing. It signals when new imagery is available for processing. SQS receives events from the system, such as when new imagery is stored in EFS, and triggers image processing workflows. SQS enables decoupling of components, allowing asynchronous communication and reliable message delivery.

### 7. EC2 Instances
These instances perform image processing tasks by retrieving imagery from EFS, executing processing algorithms, and handling large-scale computation. EC2 instances pull imagery from EFS based on SQS events and process it according to the defined pipeline. EC2 provides scalable computing resources, allowing for flexible and cost-effective management of processing loads.

### 8. Apache Airflow
This tool manages and orchestrates complex workflows for image processing, including scheduling and monitoring tasks. It coordinates the execution of processing steps and ensures that tasks are executed in the correct sequence. Apache Airflow provides a powerful platform for managing workflows, which is essential for orchestrating various processing steps.

### 9. AWS Batch
This service manages and executes batch processing jobs for handling large-scale computational tasks. It executes parallel processing jobs defined by the processing pipeline and scales resources as needed based on job requirements. AWS Batch offers efficient, scalable, and cost-effective batch processing by automating compute resource management and job execution.

### 10. Amazon S3
This component stores processed imagery and analysis results. It receives and stores output from image processing tasks and provides durable and scalable storage for results. S3 offers high durability, scalability, and availability, making it ideal for storing large volumes of processed data.

### 11. DynamoDB
This service stores metadata and structured results for quick lookups and efficient querying. It stores and retrieves metadata related to processed imagery, providing fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

Pipeline workflow:
1. **Client Request**: The process begins when a client submits a request through the Client Interface. They specify parameters such as the desired time frame, area of interest, image provider, and type of imagery.

2. **Request Handling**: The Client Interface forwards the request to the API Gateway.

3. **Request Processing**: The API Gateway handles authorization and authentication of the request. It then forwards the request to the Analysis Ready Data Service (ARDS).

4. **Metadata Check**: ARDS checks the availability of the requested imagery. It queries MongoDB to verify if the metadata and the state of the requested imagery are available.
